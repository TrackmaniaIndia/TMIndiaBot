# Contributing to TMIndiaBot

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

* spaces (4) for indentation
* use the black formatter for style unification

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GNU GPLv3 License.
